# TSP - Javascript
 Solving a TSP problem and adding google maps integration in a smart web-ui.

 This is using the google maps API, and is meant to be run on a server. Is usually running on the website spoopy.ddns.net. Still has some cleaning up to do, but works for driving, public transport, walking and biking.
